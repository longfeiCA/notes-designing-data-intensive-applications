# Designing Data-Intensive Applications
The big ideas behind reliable, scalable, and maintainable systems. 

## Goal
The goal of this book is to help you navigate the diverse and fast-changing landscape of technologies for processing and storing data. You will understand how tools can be combined to form the foundation of a good application architecture. 

## Design Software that has:

1. **Reliability**: Tolerating hardware & software faults; Human error

2. **Scalability**: Measuring load & performance; Lantency

3. **Maintainability**: Operability, simplicity & evolvability


## Scope & Arrangements

### Scope
1. No technical details on how to install or use specific software packages or APIs. 
2. This  book  doesn’t  have  space  to  cover  deployment, operations,  security,  management,  and  other  areas—those  are  complex  and  important topics, and we wouldn’t do them justice by making them superficial side notes in this book. They deserve books of their own.

### Arrangements
This book is arranged in three parts:  

1. In  Part  I,  we  discuss  the  fundamental  ideas  that  underpin  the  design  of data-intensive  applications.  We  start  in  Chapter  1  by  discussing  what  we’re  actually
trying  to  achieve:  reliability,  scalability,  and  maintainability;  how  we  need  to think about them; and how we can achieve them. In Chapter 2 we compare several different data models and query languages, and see how they are appropriate to different situations. In Chapter 3 we talk about storage engines: how databases arrange  data  on  disk  so  that  we  can  find  it  again  efficiently.  Chapter  4  turns  to formats for data encoding (serialization) and evolution of schemas over time.

2. In Part II, we move from data stored on one machine to data that is distributed across  multiple  machines.  This  is  often  necessary  for  scalability,  but  brings  with it  a  variety  of  unique  challenges.  We  first  discuss  replication  (Chapter  5),  partitioning sharding  (Chapter  6),  and  transactions  (Chapter  7).  We  then  go  into more  detail  on  the  problems  with  distributed  systems  (Chapter  8)  and  what  it means to achieve consistency and consensus in a distributed system (Chapter 9).

3. In  Part  III,  we  discuss  systems  that  derive  some  datasets  from  other  datasets. Derived data often occurs in heterogeneous systems: when there is no one database  that  can  do  everything  well,  applications  need  to  integrate  several  different databases,  caches,  indexes,  and  so  on.  In  Chapter  10  we  start  with  a  batch  processing approach to derived data, and we build upon it with stream processing in Chapter  11.  Finally,  in  Chapter  12  we  put  everything  together  and  discuss approaches  for  building  reliable,  scalable,  and  maintainable  applications  in  the future.
